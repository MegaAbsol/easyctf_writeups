# 40 - Networking

*Written by Emily Leng*

## Problem

Networking covers everything that is related to our computer's interactions with other computers over the Internet or through some other connection. Sometimes we can trace these interactions and analyze them in order to acquire information.

You might need to install a piece of software called WireShark for this problem. Analyze the input file and look through all packets for information that might be related to a flag.

Here is the file in an online viewer, CloudShark:

Alternatively, here is the source file if you like to download it and view it in WireShark:

## Hint

It seems like information is being recorded as a form is submitted, through a POST request.

## Solution
Looking through the network packets, there is a HTTP POST request with the following values:

```
username=ctf&password=flagisnetworkingispowerful&submit=Login
```

## Flag
`networkingispowerful`
